My wife and I are climbing together now. I was originally interested in climbing back in college, when they put in a wall in our main gym, but never really had a chance to get into it. My brother did however, and I was always a bit jealous. But, I am quite glad now that my wife and I are able to start the journey together. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/752921d7-6b6e-4e1e-bbcd-cb417633bdc7.jpg)
