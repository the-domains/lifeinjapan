Hello, so I am having a hard time understanding this Grid thing.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a8e6e036-90cb-4d9c-9b07-21110aab14f9.jpg)

I have been living in Japan for 11 1/2 years.  Japan has been my home for the last decade and change. I originally moved out here because I wanted to continue my Japanese study (I majored in Japanese linguistics in college). I originally only planned to stay for 1 - 2 years, but things just kind of happened, and here I am. The first real thing that I will tell you is that, life has been great.

"People are very nice"

"Customer service is amazing"

"Food is amazing, no matter where you go"
