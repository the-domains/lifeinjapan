I have been living in Japan for 11 1/2 years.

Japan has been my home for the last decade and change. I originally moved out here because I wanted to continue my Japanese study (I majored in Japanese linguistics in college). I originally only planned to stay for 1 - 2 years, but things just kind of happened, and here I am.
